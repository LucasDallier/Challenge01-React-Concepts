🚀 <b>Challenge01 React Concepts</b> 🚀

In this challenge, I create an application to train what I've learned so far in ReactJS, based on module 01 of Rocketseat's bootcamp

This will be an application where my main goal is a small application of activities to do, to train a little more about state manipulation in React and JavaScript.

- Add a new task
- Remove a task
- Mark and unmark a task as done
